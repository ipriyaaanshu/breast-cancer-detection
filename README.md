# Breast-Cancer-Detection
This data has been taken from the University of California Irvine's machine learning repository. It is a standard dataset that can be used to apply and test the efficiency and accuracy of various advanced classification algorithms on such data. Fortunately, I managed to get a 100% test accuracy without over-fitting the model, want to see which algorithm gave such awesome accuracy?

### Using the Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic data set for predictive analysis

Attribute Information:

 - 1) ID number 
 - 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 
 
   -3-32.Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

 - a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
 - b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
 - c) perimeter 
 - d) area 
 - e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
 - f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
 - g). concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
 - h). concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
 - i). symmetry 
 - j). fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.
